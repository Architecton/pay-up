PayUpâ„¢

The application, that we have envisioned, is a tool for personal financial loan management. It does not perform transactions, it merely keeps track of them.
A user can register an account, which allows thim to add users to his own associate list, from which he can create loans.

1. Sites:

index.html - The main web page of the application. It contains a logo, short description of the app and the team, along with development news. The user can access other parts of the application using an always-present navigation bar, which changes dynamically when the user logs on.

access the main functionalities of the app - user and loan management.

contacts.html - A control subpanel, where the user can see a list of all his contacts. Contacts can be added manually or from a database of existing users. When a contact is selected, more information about him appears.

loans.html - A control subpanel, which enables the user to create, delete and edit his loans. The list of loans can be sorted and filtered. When a loan is selected from the list, editing options open on the right side of the page. Whenever a loan is edited, it's status is set to "pending" until both parties agree with the change.
